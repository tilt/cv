          Fairix is a startup I took part in as a software engineer while I was a student of mathematics. Fairix provided a platform to producers and merchants enabling them to offer products with additional ecological or social value, e.g. fair trade products. In an engineering team of two we developed a marketplace platform with Ruby on Rails. For that purpose I learnt Rails from scratch and I was leading the development in the later course of the project when the platform launched. The startup finally ran out of funds after two years.

          At my internship at the BSI I worked on research topics about malware classification. The internship lasted two months and together with my mentor I implemented a pattern recognition and a clustering approach to identify and distinguish malware by the kinds of exploits it used. The software had to be extremely performant and of linear complexity and was written in C.
