              Fairix is a startup I took part in as a software engineer while I was a student of mathematics. Fairix provided a platform to producers and merchants enabling them to offer products with additional ecological or social value, e.g. fair trade products. In an engineering team of two we developed a marketplace platform with Ruby on Rails. For that purpose I learnt Rails from scratch and I was leading the development in the later course of the project when the platform launched. The startup finally ran out of funds after two years.
